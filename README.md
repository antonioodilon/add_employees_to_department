# add_employees_to_department
This command-line program written in Rust allows the user to add names, from a vector of strings that contains names of employees from a fictional company, to departments from that company. The departments are keys in a hashmap of that company, while the values are vectors of strings, which means that each department has its own associated vector with the names of the employees who become part of it as soon as the user adds them. Finally, the original vector of strings with names of employees is still available to the user after the names have been added to the departments.
